# iOS-WeatherKitProject
Final project for my iOS development course

Testing out the weather kit for SwiftUI, and also trying to override it's api in case the user feels like the weather is wrong, and has an option to input their own info on the weather.

This is just a bottom tier app, since API is very restricted, and Apples WeatherKit is much better, so don't expect much on frontend or any good data...
